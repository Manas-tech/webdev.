<h1 style="color: blue;" > What is Civil Engineering :</h1>
<h2>  civil engineering, the profession of designing and executing structural works that serve the general public, such as dams, bridges, aqueducts, canals, highways, power plants, sewerage systems, and other infrastructure. The term was first used in the 18th century to distinguish the newly recognized profession from military engineering, until then preeminent. From earliest times, however, engineers have engaged in peaceful activities, and many of the civil engineering works of ancient and medieval times—such as the Roman public baths, roads, bridges, and aqueducts; the Flemish canals; the Dutch sea defenses; the French Gothic cathedrals; and many other monuments—reveal a history of inventive genius and persistent experimentation. </h2>

<h2> Types of Civil Engineering
    The broad field of civil engineering contains several specialised sub-disciplines, spanning a range of industries and including both practical and more theoretical tasks. These different types of civil engineering are based on a mixture of location and specialisations, starting with general civil engineering:<br>
    
    1. General Civil Engineering
    Also known as site engineering, these civil engineers work with surveyors and more specialised civil engineers to design services such as drainage, dams, electrical supply infrastructure, pavements, sewer services, communications infrastructures, and more. This type of engineering is generally concerned with converting an area of land from one use to another. This includes site visits, meetings with stakeholders, construction planning and development, as well as assessing potential impacts, including for the environment.
    <br>
    2. Coastal Engineering
    This branch of civil engineering is concerned with the management of coastal areas, including protection against flooding and coastal erosion. It is also sometimes known as coastal protection, coastal defence and coastal management.
    <br>
    3. Construction Engineering
    Construction engineers are involved in the planning, transportation and use of construction materials, using environmental, geotechnical, hydraulic and structural engineering knowledge. This role often involves a lot of contract drafting, logistics and supply monitoring to create plans that can then be used by construction managers.
    <br>
    4. Earthquake Engineering
    This sub-discipline of structural engineering involves the design, build and maintenance of structures capable of withstanding exposure to earthquakes while maintaining compliance with building codes and regulations.
    <br>
    5. Environmental Engineering
    This branch of engineering is the modern version of what was once called sanitary engineering. It now includes hazardous waste management and environmental remediation in addition to the treatment of chemical, biological and thermal waste, recycling, and the purification of the air, land and water. Environmental engineers are also involved in assessing the environmental consequences of proposed actions.
